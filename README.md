# Minesweeper

Minesweeper is a single-player puzzle video game. The objective of the game is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden "mines" or bombs without detonating any of them, with help from clues about the number of neighboring mines in each field.

I created text version in Julia console. You can play in two game types: 8x8 grid and 16x16 grid. Have fun!
